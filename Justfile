# `release` publishes the CURRENT OS's artifact only, so a full release is
# `just release-patch` on the FIRST machine (which bumps, publishes, commits
# and tags), then a bare `just release` on the other two after pulling that
# commit — same version, same GitHub Release, other platforms' artifacts.
#
# The steps run as sub-`just` processes, never as Just dependencies: just
# evaluates variables once at parse time, so VERSION would still hold the
# PRE-bump value if these ran as deps — the tag and the commit message would
# name the old version while package.json already said the new one.

# Releases come off a clean tree: the release commit must carry the version
# bump and nothing else, and a tag whose content is unprovable is worse than
# no tag at all. Commit your work first, with a message that describes it.
